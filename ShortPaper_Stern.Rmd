```

Development projects from 2000-2015 overwhelmingly received satisfactory ratings, with most regions having nearly three quarters of all projects rated "marginally satisfactory", "satisfactory", or "highly satisfactory". Melanesia and Micronesia are the notable exceptions to this trend, with the majority of projects evaluated to be "marginally unsatisfactory", "unsatisfactory", or "highly unsatisfactory". It is possible that  project performance is hindered by the difficult implementation conditions of small island nations hinders or the relatively limited donor experince in these regions (due to the smaller number of projects). Eastern Asia leads all regions in project success, with the fewest projects receiving ratings on the unsatisfactory half of the scale, and the most projects receiving the top "highly satisfactory" rating.

```

To dig deeper into the geographic distribution of project performance, we examine the countries that have the highest proportion of unsatisfactory projects. Two key findings jump out: first, all projects in Nauru and Botswana captured in the databse since 2000 are unsatisfactory, though these results must be interpreted with caution given the small number of projects (n = 1 and n = 5 respectively). Second, even though all regions of Africa had less than 30% unsuccessful projects overall, we see several African countries on the top 20 list. This begs further exploration into the determinants of project performance in these countries.

  th
```

The plot above highlights an interesting split in performance between sectors that build human capital (health, education, sanitation, etc.) and sectors that build economic capital (governance, infrastructure, energy, etc.). The performance trends in Africa are fairly parallel with other continents in the most funded economic capital sectors, but diverge in the most funded human capital sectors: health, education, reproductive health, and water and sanitation. We also see that the direction of the divergence varies across sectors: Africa improves more than other continents in education and water and sanitation, while other continents out-improve Africa in health and reproductive health. This plot also highlights the strong negative trend for both Africa and other continents in action related to debt.

Ghanaian political and non-governmental development leaders diverge considerably from donors in their how they prioritize the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (measured through survey responses for leaders and by relative funding amounts for donors). The largest divergences can be seen in economic growth (which leaders ranked 1 and donors ranked 6) and good health (which leaders ranked 7 and donors ranked 1). We also see that the goals with the worst performance all more highly prioritized by donors than leaders (falling below the line which represents the axis of equal donor and leader prioritization). This illuminates a possible correlation between diverging prioritizatin and project performance that merits further exploration.

This chart illuminates that the World Bank is not only far and away the largest donor to Ghana since 2000, but also tends to fund fewer, higher cost projects in its most funded Sustainable Development Goals of good health and peace, justice, and strong institutions. However, a result of this is that a single large unsatisfactory World Bank health project dramatically changes the performance composition of the entire sector in Ghana. We also observe considerable specialization across donors, with DFID emerging as the dominant funder of quality education and sole funder of gender equality, and the World Bank dominating the good health goal and serving as the sole funder of affordable/clean energy.

```

Does a larger project budget translate to better management and higher performance? Or are large-scale projects unweildy and difficult to manage? The graph above provides weak evidence that the group of projects that receive the highest performance ranking have a larger share of high-cost programs. However, we see by the overlapping box-plots across categories for all three evaluation types that this difference is likely insignificant. We also see that the most common evaluation type is by an independent evaluation office, which is driven by the large number World Bank and the Asian Development Bank projects that are evaluated by this method.

  )

```

The plot above shows the distribution of World Bank funding since 2000 by continent and Sustainable Development Goal. We clearly see that approximately half of World Bank funding has gone to Asia, where the Bank enjoys strong project performance across sectors. Africa is a different story- where at least 30% of projects are unsatisfactory across all goals except for Sustainable Cities, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Industry and Infrastructure. We also see that Health is an outlier in North America, with at least 30% of World Bank projects receiving unsatisfactory rankings.

       caption = "Sources: Project Performance Database (Honig 2018), Natural Earth 4.1.0") 

```

The above map shows that 5 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are the most-funded in the vast majority of countries. The map also illustrates clear regional trends in the most highly funded SDG by country. We see that the group of neighboring African countries Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, and Niger receive the most funding for peace, justice, and strong institutions, likely explained by the history of conflict in that region. Interestingly, funding for affordable energy dominates Central and East Asia, perhaps signaling that such investments are particularly successful in this region.

This map illustrates several interesting spatial patterns of World Bank and Chinese funding in Ghana. First, we see a clear concentration of Chinese funding in the district containing the Bui Dam. This hydroelectric energy project funded in large part by the two credits from China Exim Bank totalling over $550 million. We also see that there is a much greater concentration of Chinese investment than World Bank in northern Ghana, likely driven by China's investments in mining in that region of the country. While both China and the World Bank see a concentration of funding in major cities, namely the capital of Accra, World Bank funding is far more evenly distributed throughout Ghana than Chinese funding.
