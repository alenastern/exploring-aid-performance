# exploring-aid-performance

International Development Organizations (IDOs) spend millions of dollars every year assessing the effectiveness of their development projects through internal and external evaluations. However, this information often remains locked away in pdfs or siloed in individual organization databases, making it difficult to understand cross-donor trends in development effectiveness. In 2018, Dr. Dan Honig, Assistant Professor of International Development at Johns Hopkins SAIS, released the [Project Performance Database (PPD)](https://danhonig.info/), which brings together information on project performance from eight IDOs  between 1973 and 2013. The PPD contains data on over 14,000 unique projects across 178 countries. 

This repository contains analysis of this exciting new data source to examine the determinants of project success and trends in project performance. Specifically, this repository contains data visualizations that explore the following questions:
*	How does project performance vary across IDOs , sectors, Sustainable Development Goals, partner countries, and time?
*	What project and country-specific factors are the most correlated with project performance? How do these factors vary across sectors?
*	Do projects that are more aligned with partner country leader and/or citizen development priorities perform better?
*	Are performance rankings sensitive to domestic political pressure in IDO countries?

## Repository Structure
* `data`: contains raw source data
